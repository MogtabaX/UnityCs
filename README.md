Weapon Recoil is a procedural value-based recoil that uses Rigidbodies to deal with real-world physics to simulate a recoil 

Weapon Aim does the same thing, it is customizable in terms of speed and position

Weapon Yaw is the body's reactions to mouse movement both horizontal and vertical 

all of the mentioned scripts deal with rigidbody as the main source of animation.
